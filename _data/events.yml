- name: Training end-to-end Neural Taggers Without Labeled Data
  description: Join us for a workshop about sequence tagging with Professor Bach!

Sequence tagging is an important class of structured prediction problems in which each element in an input sequence is tagged with a class. It arises in many natural language processing applications, such as named entity recognition (NER), semantic role labeling (SRL), and sentence compression. However, the expense of collecting large hand-labeled datasets for training sequence taggers has long motivated the search for alternative sources of supervision.

In this workshop, Professor Bach will introduce WISER, a novel framework for training sequence tagging models with weak supervision from user-written rules. We will show how to use WISER to train state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence tagging without any labeled data.
